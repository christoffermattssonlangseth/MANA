# Archive: Development Notebooks

This directory contains earlier exploratory notebooks from the MANA development process.

## Notebooks

### MANA-0.ipynb
Initial exploration and proof-of-concept for metric-aware neighborhood aggregation.

### MANA-1.ipynb
Early parameter testing and method development.

### MANA-2.ipynb
Continued refinement of aggregation approach.

### MANA-3.ipynb
Pre-systematic testing experiments.

### cellcharter.ipynb
Original CellCharter implementation for comparison.

### comparing-mana-cellcharter.ipynb
Direct comparison between MANA and CellCharter approaches.

## Current Work

For the current, production-ready notebooks, see:
- **[../MANA-4.ipynb](../MANA-4.ipynb)**: Systematic parameter optimization (hop_decay, n_layers)
- **[../MANA-5.ipynb](../MANA-5.ipynb)**: Aggregation method comparison (mean, median, max, etc.)

These archived notebooks are kept for reference but are not actively maintained.
